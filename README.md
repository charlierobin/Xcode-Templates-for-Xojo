# Xcode Templates for Xojo v1.1    
  
**Installation:**    
  
[Download the templates](https://github.com/jimmckay/Xcode-Templates-for-Xojo/releases).     
  
Move the iOS and macOS folders to "~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates" creating folders as needed.    
  
**Usage:**    
  
Create an Xcode project using the **Xojo App** or **Xojo iOS App** template with the same name as your Xojo project.     
  
Save the Xcode project into a folder named Xcode **next to your Xojo project**    
  
In the Xcode project, set capabilites (sandbox, entitlements, hardened runtime etc) and enable development codesigning    
  
In the Xcode project, see the **Usage.md** file for the build scripts to add to your Xojo project.  
  
After the build scripts have been enabled, the app will appear in the **Xcode Organizer Window**  after a build.
  
Access the Organizer in the Xcode menu **Window->Organizer**  
  
If you've added the debug script to a Xojo Mac App project, the app will run in sadboxed mode when debugging.
